                I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I feel like it’s finally time to be honest with you. Every time I’m around you, there’s this feeling I can’t quite shake a mixture of excitement,nervousness and the comfort i get that I can’t explain. The more I get to know you, the more I realize how much I admire you. It’s not just the little things you do, but the way you carry yourself, the kindness you show, and the way you make me feel valued.
                I’ve tried to keep it to myself, but I can’t deny how much I love you. It’s more than just attraction; it’s the way you make me feel like I can be myself without hesitation. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I wanted to let you know how much you mean to me. I really love like  you, and I’d love to see where this could go, if you feel the same. But no matter what, I hope this doesn’t change anything between us, because I value what we have, and I’m grateful for you in my life.
